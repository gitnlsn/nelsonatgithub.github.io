      <description>Delaunay triangulation is a special triangulation, where the circumcircle of any triangle in the triangulation does not contain any vertex in its interior. L&amp;rsquo;idée was proposed in 1934 by Boris Delaunay in his paper Sur la Sphère Vide [1]. The triangulation&amp;rsquo;s emptiness property maximizes the minimum interior angle of the triangles in the triangulation and has important applications to several areas, including mesh generation.
A robust C-language implementation of mesh generation and refinement that applies Delaunay triangulation is Triangle, made by Jonathan Richard Shewchuk in 1996: Engineering a 2D Quality Mesh Generator and Delaunay Triangulator [2].</description>
