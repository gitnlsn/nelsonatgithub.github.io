      <description>GBIF provides very large datasets of biological beings. I downloaded a dataset and implemented some infrastructure to present it in the browser. The dataset had 7 million entries. I grouped them into 757 entries. I developed a Restful API to provide the data through HTTP protocol and a ReactApp that may consume it. Currently, everything is deployed in Heroku. The Link to the site is here. Deployment is under free account so loading is a bit slow.</description>
